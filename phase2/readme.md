# Statistical Analysis of Znnd-Unikernel vs. Docker and Baremetal

This analysis compares the performance of three different deployment modes: baremetal, znnd-docker, and znnd-unikernel, focusing on boot time and time to first momentum (TTM). The specifications for each setup are as follows:

## Specifications

- **Baremetal:**
  - **Hardware:** 300 GB SSD, 12 GB RAM, 8 CPU
  - **Operating System:** Fedora
  
- **Docker:**
  - **Deployment:** Docker image running on the baremetal server
  
- **Unikernel:**
  - **Virtual Machine:** XEN VM
  - **Hardware:** 10 GB HDD, 8 GB RAM, 4 CPU

## Performance Metrics

The performance metrics measured include:
- **Boot Time (ms):** Time taken for the system to boot.
- **Time to First Momentum (TTM) (ms):** Time taken to reach the first momentum.

## Data Summary

- **Baremetal:**
  - **Boot Time:** Mean = 11500 ms, Standard Deviation = 338.17 ms
  - **TTM:** Mean = 28500 ms, Standard Deviation = 473.51 ms

- **Znnd-Docker:**
  - **Boot Time:** Mean = 1944 ms, Standard Deviation = 43.90 ms
  - **TTM:** Mean = 12400 ms, Standard Deviation = 212.63 ms

- **Znnd-Unikernel:**
  - **Boot Time:** Mean = 150 ms, Standard Deviation = 1.51 ms
  - **TTM:** Mean = 895 ms, Standard Deviation = 4.32 ms

## Statistical Analysis

1. **Boot Time:**
   - **Znnd-Unikernel** shows a significantly lower mean boot time (150 ms) compared to **Znnd-Docker** (1944 ms) and **Baremetal** (11500 ms).
   - The standard deviation for Znnd-Unikernel (1.51 ms) indicates very tight clustering around the mean, implying high consistency and reliability in boot times.

2. **Time to First Momentum (TTM):**
   - **Znnd-Unikernel** also achieves a much lower mean TTM (895 ms) compared to **Znnd-Docker** (12400 ms) and **Baremetal** (28500 ms).
   - Similar to boot time, the TTM standard deviation for Znnd-Unikernel (4.32 ms) is significantly smaller, reflecting consistent performance.

## Discussion

The data reveals that the Znnd-Unikernel setup offers **statistically significant** advantages in both boot time and TTM over both the Znnd-Docker and Baremetal setups. The tighter standard deviations for Znnd-Unikernel further highlight its consistency and predictability in performance.

1. **Znnd-Unikernel vs. Znnd-Docker:**
   - Znnd-Unikernel boots approximately 13 times faster than Znnd-Docker.
   - The time to reach first momentum is reduced by almost 14 times in the Znnd-Unikernel setup compared to Znnd-Docker.
   - These differences are highly significant, with Znnd-Unikernel demonstrating much lower variability, suggesting more reliable performance.

2. **Znnd-Unikernel vs. Baremetal:**
   - Znnd-Unikernel boots about 77 times faster than the baremetal configuration.
   - The TTM for Znnd-Unikernel is about 32 times faster than that of baremetal.
   - Given the considerable reduction in both boot time and TTM, along with minimal variability, Znnd-Unikernel presents a clear advantage in scenarios requiring rapid deployment and minimal downtime.

## Conclusion

In summary, Znnd-Unikernel demonstrates statistically significant improvements in both boot time and time to first momentum compared to Znnd-Docker and Baremetal configurations. This suggests that for environments where rapid deployment and consistent performance are critical, Znnd-Unikernel is the superior choice. The analysis underscores Znnd-Unikernel's efficiency and reliability, making it a highly effective solution for performance-sensitive applications.
